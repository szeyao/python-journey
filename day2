Q1 Iterate 10 times code
Ans:
    i = 10
    while i:
        print('any loops')
        i = i - 1


Q2 Short-circuit logic  OR  lazy evaluation
Ans:
    0 or 0 or 3 or 4   # or return the first 'TRUE'
    output: 3
    
    1 and 0 and 5        # and return the first 'FALSE'
    output: 0


Q3 A small game: 
      Guess a random number from 1 to 10 within 3 attempts,
      A hint will be given for each wrong guess, 
      Game will end if the correct number is given
Ans:
    import random
    secret = random.randint(1,10)                  #Random number for each new game
    limit = 3                                      #Only 3 attempts are allowed
    attempt = 0
    number= input('guess a number?')
    guess = int(number)

    if guess == secret:
        print('Correct!')
    else:
        while guess != secret:
            attempt = attempt + 1
            print('You have '+str(limit - attempt)+' more attempts:')
            if attempt == limit:
                print('GAME OVER!!!')
                break
            if guess > secret:
                    temp= input('Wrong, Make a smaller guess pls:')
                    guess = int(temp)
            if guess < secret:
                    temp= input('Wrong, Make a bigger guess pls:')
                    guess = int(temp)
            if guess == secret:
                print('Correct!')
                
Possible output: 
    guess a number?6
    You have 2 more attempts:
    Wrong, Make a bigger guess pls:8
    You have 1 more attempts:
    Wrong, Make a smaller guess pls:7
    Correct!
